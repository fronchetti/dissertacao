# About
We believe that showing what our model is capable of doing is important. For this reason, we created an application using [Streamlit](https://contributing.streamlit.app/) where users can provide a repository and the model returns predictions for their CONTRIBUTING.md file. 

If you are interested in this application, give it a try at: https://contributing.streamlit.app/. 

Newer releases of this application are being committed to: https://github.com/fronchetti/contributing.info/.

# Acknowledgment
This application is being hosted through Streamlit Cloud for free. We thank the maintainers of Streamlit for their services.
