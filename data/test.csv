Here's how it works:,No categories identified.
"Special tooling has been built to collect all source files with appropriate overrides into a unique
staging directory for each flavor (each staging directory is also specified by a target
architecture). From a staging directory, containers can be built directly from the
<staging>/daemon-base/ and <staging>/daemon/ image directories. Additionally, developers can
inspect a staging directory's files to view exactly what will be (or has been) built into the
container images. Additionally, in order to maintain a core source base that is as reusable as
possible for all flavors, staging also supports a very basic form of templating. Some tooling has
been developed to make working with staging as easy as possible.",DC – Deal with the code

"The src/ directory contains the core code that is applicable for all flavors -- all Ceph versions
and all distros -- and is the ""least specific"" definition of source files for this project. This
includes the ceph-container-specific code that is built into the container images as well as build
configuration files. src/ should be viewed as the base set of functionality all flavors must
implement. To maximize reuse and keep the core source base in one place, care should be taken to try
to make the core source applicable to all flavors whenever possible. Note the existence of the
""CEPH_VERSION"" environment variable (and other similar variables) built into the containers.
ceph-container source code can use container environment variables to execute code paths
conditionally, making an override of source files for specific Ceph versions unnecessary.",No categories identified.

"To benefit the better support, require Carbon using major version range (^1 or ^2). By requiring 1.26.*,
~1.26.0 or limited range such as >=1.20 <1.33, you fall to low priority support (only security and critical issues
will be fixed), our prior support goes to next minor releases of each major version. It applies to bug fixes and
low-cost features. Other new features will only be added in the last stable release. At the opposite, we recommend you
to restrain to a major number, as there is no compatibility guarantee from a major version to the next. It means
requiring >=2, as it allows any newer version, will probably leads to errors on releasing our next major version.",No categories identified.

"We want the software to have decent performance for typical users.
Our goal is interaction in 1 second or less after making a request.
Don't send megabytes of data for a request
(see
The Website Obesity Crisis).
Use caching (at the server, CDN, and user side) to improve performance
in typical cases (while avoiding making the code too complicated).
Moving all the JavaScripts to a long-lived cached page, for example,
means that the user only needs to load that page once.
See the ""other tools"" list below for some tools to help measure performance.
There's always a trade-off between various attributes, in particular,
don't make performance so fast that the software is hard to maintain.
Instead, work to get ""reasonable"" performance in typical cases.",DC – Deal with the code
