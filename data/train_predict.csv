"Main Concepts is designed to introduce fundamental concepts in a step-by-step way. Each individual article in Main Concepts builds on the knowledge from the previous ones, so make sure not to add any ""cyclical dependencies"" between them. It is important that the reader can start with the first article and work their way to the last Main Concepts article without ever having to ""look ahead"" for a definition. This explains some ordering choices (e.g. that state is explained before events, or that ""thinking in React"" doesn't use refs). Main Concepts also serves as a reference manual for React concepts, so it is important to be very strict about their definitions and relationships between them. This is, for example, why we introduce elements before components. Resist adding too much detail to Main Concepts articles. They intentionally don't cover all corner cases, and focus on establishing firm foundations.",No categories identified.

"- the plotly.express package (usually imported as px) is a high-level
functional API. Its code is in packages/python/plotly/express. Most
functions of plotly.express call the internal _make_figure function
in _core.py. More generally, the internals of px consist of general
functions taking care of building the figure (defining subplots, traces
or frames, for example), with special cases for different traces handled
within these functions. There is also subsequent code reuse for px
docstrings, in particular for documenting parameters.",No categories identified.
