We observed a few things during the analysis, which are reported below:

- For some chinese projects (e.g. alibaba/ice), weird versions of common characters appeared. 
  For example, instead of using ":" they used "ï¼š". In some cases, these characters
  were automatically replaced by the question mark "?", in other cases, the string was broken. 
  We manually fixed each corrupted paragraph.
