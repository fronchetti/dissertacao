# Qualification
In a first attempt to provide substantial data for the machine learning
classifiers, the authors of this study asked undergraduate students 
from two universities in Brazil to analyze OSS projects spreadsheets.
However, the spreadsheets analyzed during this first attempt were not
significant enough to result in a good classification performance.

Considering the time and availability constraints to analyze more data, 
the authors decided to change the strategy of analysis. At the end,
two authors analyzed the spreadsheets that you may find in the data folder. 
None of the worksheets analyzed by the students were used, although they are
publicly available in this folder for clarity.

At University B, the students who participated in the analysis were also
part of a class about open source development. One of their assignments in class
was to contribute with one OSS project. For this reason, we also asked them to
report their perspectives as newcomers during the contribution process. In folder
`university_b` you may also find their diaries.
